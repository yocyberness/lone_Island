on a cliff
small island side.
other side just out of reach but could maybe jump.
girl in yellow coat ont he oother side hidden in the bushes looks to be having the time of her life.
if just the edge could crumble and not have another chance.
dark and stormy, alone

sunny lush amazing on the other side.

I it here, looking over to the other side, so close but out of reach.
Sometimes I see her, a glint of bright yellow frashing from the other side, 
Im always wondering what she is thinking. noticing me? wanting me to Join?
