on a cliff
small island side.
other side just out of reach but could maybe jump.
bird (she) in yellow coat on the other side hidden in the bushes looks to be having the time of her life.
if just the edge could crumble and not have another chance.
dark and stormy, alone

sunny lush amazing on the other side.

I it here, looking over to the other side, so close but out of reach.
Sometimes I see her, a glint of bright yellow frashing from the other side, 
Im always wondering what she is thinking. noticing me? wanting me to Join?

It seems like forever that I have been here, although I cant really remember when it started or even how it all came about.
Im sure it was not alway like this, I know it in fact deep in my mind that it cant have always been but I cant seem to grasp what came before. Now looking forwards it never seens to matter anymore anyway, distant memories clouded now through these repeated days.
Each morning I wake up in a soft, comfortable sleeping bag next to the dying embers of what seems to be the previous nights fire. The air is chilled as if with the winds of a winter storm, it bites my exposed skin and makes me want to recede back into the warth of the sleeping back.

The morning routine as if its the last time. take stock.

wash in a small puddle left from rain I have never seen, see my reflection. never shave but only slight stubble, its the same every day.

Hungry, eat some fruit but its the last pieces, not sure what it is but is sweet with a "look up description ok kiwi taste"

take in the surroundings, walk one slow lap around the island.

Slate, some scrubby bushes, a few lose rocks

storm from the dark endless sea far far below. reminds me of a painting from a long time ago by jackson pollock, blue poles wha the name
