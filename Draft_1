on a cliff
small island side.
other side just out of reach but could maybe jump.
bird (she) in yellow coat on the other side hidden in the bushes looks to be having the time of her life.
if just the edge could crumble and not have another chance.
dark and stormy, alone

sunny lush amazing on the other side.

I sit here, looking over to the other side, so close but out of reach.
Sometimes I see her, a glint of bright yellow frashing from the other side, 
Im always wondering what she is thinking. noticing me? wanting me to Join?


It seems like forever that I have been here, although I cant really remember when it started or even how it all came about.
Im sure it was not alway like this, I know it in fact deep in my mind that it cant have always been but I cant seem to grasp what came before. Now looking forwards it never seens to matter anymore anyway, distant memories clouded now through these repeated days.

Each morning I wake up in a soft, comfortable sleeping bag next to the dying embers of what seems to be the previous nights fire. The air is chilled as if with the winds of a winter storm, it bites my exposed skin and makes me want to recede back into the warth of the sleeping back.

I lay for a while like I have every recent morrning and take stock of my thoughts, try to gather them and sift what coherence I can. Everthing in the now is so clear, this is no dream. Reality presses its vivid light in to my eyes through my retnia and into my brain. I feel the cold crisp bite fo the air in my lungs. My body feels well rested. Yet as I try to think back to anything before these endles cold days Im met with a fog masking the way to what has come before. I can feel things inside, perhaps on the other side but just can grasp them through to see what they really are. So Im stuck with th thoughts of these days, to live them again.

Slowly I unzip the sleeping bag slowly stand up and take a deep breath. Im wearing comportable blue levi jeans and a loose but comfrtable plain white t-shirt. No socks or shoes.

I walk over to wash my face in a small puddle left from rain I have never seen, every morning the same, always there in the same place but never seen to fill. I see my reflection for a second before my hands break the mirror like surface to splash icy pater on my short stubbled face. I never shave but have only slight red stubble, its the same every day. 

As I watch the ripples of the pudle water start to face I feel a small pang in my stomach. Im Hungry. I walk back over the the remains of the fire and see set by its side is an old but clean enameled plate with a small handfful of pieces of fruit. I reach down, pick up the fruit and slide a few pieces into my mouth and savor the flavor. The flesh is a golden green colour and a has a strong tropical sweet taste that seems a cross between a mild mango and a strawberry. I close my eyes and focus on the sensation of taste and the rythem of my slow breathing. I am calm.

Opening my eyes I take in my surroundings, They are uncanny, familiar but with a strange forign undertone that make me sutbly unccomfortable. I am on a small island, although instead of being immediatly surrounded by water this one is souring in the sky high above the water below. The island is about thirty square feet, perhaps the quuilivent of a medium one room studio aparment.
The sleeping back I have emerged from lay perfectly in the center with the island a rough circular shape of what looks like solid slate. Next to one side if the bag is the small almost dead now fire and to the other a small dead bush of about knee height. Next to the bush is the small puddle of water in a shallow indent of the islands solid stone.

I walk slowly around the edge of the island. Aside from the odd broken piece of rock there is nothing else of intrest on the surface of the island itself. Afer my short circcumnavigation I shuffle carefully a little closer to the edge and peer over to glance at what lies below.

The island sits upon a towering precipice that tapers lightly beneath for what look like hundreds and hundreds of feet. The sheer face of the slate would be surely impossible for any human to scale, let alone a specimen such as myself. So high that infact some small whisps of clouds can be made out passing dreamely below in the wind.




storm from the dark endless sea far far below. reminds me of a painting from a long time ago by jackson pollock, blue poles wha the name

a thin layer of clouds below

across a small gap. too big to jump. 

a shelf of land
 
sunny, green bright lush

into a small forest, trees of fruit green fruit, a soft gentle breeze stirs the grass

a glimpse of yellow, darting through the undergrowth and trees, teasing, tempting. 

Look back at my island dark, cold solem

DAy two

the same but the birst is closer again teasing and tempting, almost unfair

day three

bird sitting on the edge calling me. staring at me as if it dare me to come. 
Cant it just fly to join me? bring the life to my side?

jump, time slows as I ache with all my body, willing it forward with impossible invisible streength

My fingers grasp the roots of grass that cling to the rok as I cling to my life.

I slowly pull myself up, the roots creak and slowly tear and snap.

I see myself fall back as if thrid person. falling through the mist

Day four
